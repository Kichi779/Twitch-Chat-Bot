This code is a Python program that can be used to send messages to Twitch channel chat. It will read data from the text file where the code, messages and OAuth keys are stored and send messages to a specific channel at the specified frequency.

If you keep the seconds low, your internet should be fast. Slow internet and low per second texts are sent slowly.

# Installation
- Python must be installed
- If your Python is not installed, download the latest version (3.11) of python and make sure to click on the 'ADD TO PATH' during installation.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kichi779/Twitch-Chat-Bot chatbot

cd chatbot

pip install -r requirements.txt (Or you can click on install.bat file)

Then you can run it by pressing run.bat from the folder. (If run.bat doesn't work, you can open bot.py by double-clicking the file.)
```
If you have a problem, come to my discord server. If you don't understand Python, you can also come to my discord server.
